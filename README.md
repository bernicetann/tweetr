# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

This repository is the starter code for my project: I have forked and cloned this repository, then built upon it to practice my HTML, CSS, JS, JQuery and AJAX front-end skills, and my Node, Express and MongoDB back-end skills. I really enjoyed the front-end aspect of this project where I used some logic reasoning and UI skills to make it workable on just one page without having to navigate to another page.

## Screenshots
Here are some proofs of my work on this project. Check them out:
